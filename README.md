### C# 3D Platforming Game | Jan 2020 - April 2020

A 3D platforming game in written in C# with the help of the Unity Game Engine.
The game has six levels, with each having increasing difficulty. 
All art designed was by me, and my partner, Anthony, made the music. 
I learned how to communicate effectively in a group settingâ€”used version control to merge code while writing readable code for each other. 
I designed the website with HTML, CSS, and JS to emit the same feeling and aesthetic of the art I created for the game.
